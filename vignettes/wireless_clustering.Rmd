### The Wireless Indoor Localization Data

We consider the Wireless Indoor Localization Data Set, publicly available in the UCI Machine Learning Repositoryâ€™s website. This data set is used to study the performance of different indoor localization algorithms. It is available within the ``QuadratiK`` package as ``wireless``. 
```{r}
library(QuadratiK)
head(wireless)
```

The Wireless Indoor Localization data set contains the measurements of the Wi-Fi signal strength in different indoor rooms. It consists of a data frame with 2000 rows and 8 columns. The first 7 variables report the values of the Wi-Fi signal strength received from 7 different Wi-Fi routers in an office location in Pittsburgh (USA). The last column indicates the class labels, from 1 to 4, indicating the different rooms. Notice that, the Wi-Fi signal strength is measured in dBm, decibel milliwatts, which is expressed as a negative value ranging from -100 to 0. In total, we have 500 observations for each room.

Given that the Wi-Fi signal strength takes values in a limited range, it is appropriate to consider the spherically transformed observations, by $L_2$ normalization, and consequently perform the clustering algorithm on the 7-dimensional sphere.
 
We perform the clustering algorithm on the ``wireless`` data set. We consider the $K= 3, 4, 5, 6$ as possible values for the number of clusters. 
```{r}
wire <- wireless[,-8]
labels <- wireless[,8]
wire_norm <- wire/sqrt(rowSums(wire^2))
set.seed(2468)
res_pk <- pkbc(as.matrix(wire_norm),3:6)
```

To guide the choice of the number of clusters, the function ``validation`` provides cluster validation measures and graphical tools. Specifically, it displays the Elbow plot from the computed within-cluster sum of squares values and returns an object with ``IGP`` the InGroup Proportion (IGP), and ``metrics`` a table of computed evaluation measures.  This include the $k$-sample test statistics with corresponding critical value and, if the true labels are provided, the measures of adjusted rand index (ARI), Macro-Precision and Macro-Recall. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(2468)
res_validation <- validation(res_pk, true_label = labels)
res_validation$IGP
round(res_validation$metrics, 8)
```

The Elbow plots and the reported metrics suggest $K=4$ as number of clusters. This is in accordance with the know ground truth. 
Once the number of clusters is selected, the function ``summary_stat`` in the ``QuadratiK`` package can be used to obtain additional summary information with respect to the clustering results. In particular, the function provides mean, standard deviation, median, inter-quantile range, minimum and maximum computed for each variable, overall and by the assigned membership, as well as a representation of data points. For $d=2$ and $d=3$, observations are displayed on the unit circle and unit sphere, respectively. If $d>3$, the spherical PCA is applied on the data set, and the first 3 principal components are used for visualizing data points on the sphere, after application of  $L_2$ normalization. 
```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=8}
summary_clust <- stats_clusters(res_pk,4)
```

```{r}
summary_clust
```

The figure shows the data points according to the first three spherical principal components, colored by the true labels and the assigned membership. 
The clusters identified with $k=4$ achieve high performance in terms of ARI, Macro Precision and Macro Recall. The plot of points using the principal components also shows that the identified cluster follows the initial labels.
