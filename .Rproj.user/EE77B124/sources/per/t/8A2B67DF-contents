# Introduction

This document contains the replication material for the various examples used in the submitted manuscript "Goodness-of-Fit and Clustering of Spherical Data:the \texttt{QuadratiK} package in R and Python."

## Setup

Fist, the proposed package and necessary libraries are loaded for setting up the environment.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(QuadratiK)
library(sn)
library(ggplot2)
library(mvtnorm)
library(rgl)
library(GGally)
```

## Normality Test

In Example 3.1 of the manuscript, we illustrate the usage of the introduced function \texttt{kb.test} for the Normality test. We generate one sample from a multivariate standard Normal distribution, that is $\vect{x} = (\vect{x}_1,\ldots,\vect{x}_n) \sim N_d(\vect{0},\mat{I}_d)$ with dimension $d=4$, and sample size $n=500$. 

```{r normality}
n <- 500
d <- 4
set.seed(2468)
dat_norm <- rmvnorm(n, sigma = diag(d))

h = 0.4
set.seed(2468)
system.time(norm_test <- kb.test(x=dat_norm, h=h, centering="Param"))
norm_test
```
Additionally, the package provides the \texttt{summary} method for the \texttt{kb.test} output object. Together with the results of the performed test, this function provides the qq-plots of each variable with a table of standard descriptive statistics.
