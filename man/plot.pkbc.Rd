\title{Plotting method for Poisson kernel-based clustering}
\usage{
\S4method{plot}{pkbc,ANY}(x, true_label = NULL, pca_res = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{pkbc}}

\item{true_label}{factor or vector of true membership to clusters (if
available). It must have the same length of final
memberships.}

\item{pca_res}{Logical. If TRUE the results from PCALocantore when dimension
is greater than 3 are also reported.}
}
\value{
One of the following plot:
\itemize{
\item scatterplot of data points colored by final membership
\item elbow plot
}
}
\description{
Plots for a pkbc object.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item scatterplot: If dimension is equal to 2 or 3, points are displayed on the
circle and sphere, respectively. If dimension if greater than 3, the
spherical Principal Component procedure proposed by Locantore et al., (1999)
is applied for dimensionality reduction and the first three principal
components are normalized and displayed on the sphere. For d > 3, the
complete results from the \code{PcaLocantore} function (package \code{rrcov})
are returned if pca_res=TRUE.
\item elbow plot: the within cluster sum of squares (wcss) is computed using the
Euclidean distance and the cosine similarity.
